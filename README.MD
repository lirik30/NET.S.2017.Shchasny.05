Class GCD provides opportunities to find the greatest common divisor for several integers by:
 - Euclid's algorithm
 - Stein algorithm
and estimate the method execution time.

Class DoubleExtension allows us to see a double-bit representation.

Class Polynomial provides methods for working with polynomials of a real variable.
